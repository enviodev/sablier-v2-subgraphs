  /* Why use thes polymorphic functions rather than calling function directly on
  the chainworker?

  We could just call the function on the worker when matching on the chainWorker type.
  ie. ... | Rpc(worker) => worker->RpcWorker.startFetchingEvents() ...

  Instead we have these polymorphic functions that take a tuple with worker with it's module type,
  and calls the chain worker function.

  The only real benefit is that it forces us to use functions on the ChainWorker module signature.
  Which will hopefully keep this somewhat modular. 

  The chainworkerModTuple type enforces that the worker type and module conform to the chainworker 
  signature. And the polymorphic functions only call functions on that signature.

  chainWorker variants can be converted to this type, and used with the polymorphic functions.

  It's not the prettiest interface, and if readability is ever chosen over this enforced module signature
  pattern then these polymorphic functions can be removed and the functions can be accessed/called directly
  on the underlying worker module.
